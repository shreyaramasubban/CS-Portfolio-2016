        <p style = "font-family: comic sans ms"><font size ="4">Hi guys! I am a 10th grader at Summit Rainier High School. I have lived in San Jose, California my entire life with my mom, my dad, and my little brother. Right now, I don't have any pets, but I hope to in the future. </p></font>
        <h2 style = "color: crimson; font-family: comic sans ms;"><u><font size ="5"><center>My Interests</u></h2></font></center>
        <p style = "font-family: comic sans ms"><font size ="4">I love travelling to different places with my family and friends because it helps me relax. I have been to places in California, Arizona, Nevada, Washington, Washington DC, Pennsylvania, and Canada. In my spare time, I like to listen to music and watch TV and Netflix sometimes. I like to watch shows like Greys Anatomy and Pretty Little Liars; I like to watch sports like basketball too. I also play tennis, which I started when I was little. </p></font>
        <h2 style = "color: crimson; font-family: comic sans ms;"><u><font size ="5"><center>My Goals</u></h2> </font></center>
        <p style = "font-family: comic sans ms"><font size ="4">In the future, I want to be a doctor though I'm not sure what kind of doctor. I have always liked biology and I really hope I will be able to reach this goal. In addition, I would like to be extremely successful and be able to buy a big house and travel around the world to places like Hawaii and Europe. </p></font>
