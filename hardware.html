         <h2 style = "color: crimson; font-family: georgia;"><u><font size ="5"><center>Motherboard</u></h2> </font></center>
         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">It is a board that contains the circuitry, memory, CPU (the brain), and the connectors for input and output devices of the computer. The motherboard is covered by a non-conductive sheet which contains the &ldquo;busses&rdquo;, which are the layers of aluminum foil/copper that create the circuits between the different parts of the motherboard. The larger or wider these pathways are, the faster they can operate. The motherboard holds the actual CPU in the CPU socket and has the necessary parts for the CPU to be functional; it also holds the microprocessor chip and connects the parts of the computer to the chip. </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">The CPU is basically the brain of the computer; it reads and runs different programs by sending signals to the different parts of the computer. The two main parts of the CPU are the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and the CU (Control Unit). The ALU contains the electronic circuitry for performing arithmetic and logical operations on data. The CU executes instructions from retrieving the them from memory; the CU can access the ALU if necessary. The CPU looks different in large computers and personal computers. On large ones, the CPU has more printed circuit boards (ex.motherboards, expansion boards, etc.). On personal computers, the CPU itself is inside the microprocessor chip. The CPU contains metallic connectors on the bottom and is inserted into the CPU socket on the motherboard. </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">RAM, which stands for Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory. It accesses the data randomly; it doesnâ€™t need to go in a consecutive order. RAM is used as the main memory in computers because it saves time. However, RAM is a volatile memory, so it does not store memory permanently; as soon as the device loses power, the memory is gone as well. There are two types of RAM. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) is found in most personal computers because it is cheaper, but the memory needs to constantly be refreshed to save contents. SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is faster and more reliable than DRAM; however it is more expensive due to this fact. </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">Everything you do on a computer is stored on its hard drive (e.g. pictures, music, videos, etc.). The hard drive cannot read the material that is saved on it to differentiate between them; it only knows the size. The hard drive measures the size of files and other saved items in megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), and terabytes (TB). Hard drives can be inbuilt or external. Inbuilt storage is faster and more convenient because the files stored on it are always on the computer. However, inbuilt storages have a size limitation External storage can be expanded when needed, and it is more flexible because you have the files on a transferable device. You can take the files wherever you go and transfer them to another computer. The most common type of hard drive is the USB. USBs are just plugged into the computer, and the files from the USB can be read and saved immediately.  </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">A computer BUS is the printed circuits and connections which help different hardware parts to communicate with each other. The bus is made out of wires that carry the location of where the data is from and where it is being sent. Early computer buses were just parallel electric wires that connected the computer memory with peripherals (e.g. printers). Nowadays, the arrangement of wires can have parallel or serial connections. </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4">Keyboards are input devices that let you press keys to enter data into a computer. When you hit keys on your keyboard in sends in data to your computer to process. Keyboards include all the letters of the alphabet, numbers, punctuation marks, etc. Keyboards can use a wire, can be wireless, on-screen, or virtual depending on what device you are using. Since laptops and other devices are smaller than desktops, each key represents multiple characters/purposes. </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4"> Mouses are pointing devices that are also used for inputting data and information into computers. Mouses can fit under your hand and control a pointer on the screen of the device. The pointer can guide you through webpages and the Internet by clicking on links and searching up websites.  </p></font>

         <p style = "font-family: georgia"><font size ="4"> A monitor is an output device that displays the information processed by the desktop. It can display text, pictures, and videos. Monitors are separate from the actual computer case and are connected to the motherboard by a cable. Some monitors can also act as input devices if they are touch screen.  </p></font>
